# SMART STREET-LIGHT CONTROLLER
The objective of this product is to design and develop a smart street light controller system is to reduce the power consumption. 
Abstract
Now a days street light system plays a major role in rural areas and also in urban areas.
By using LDR it detects the darkness, then light will glows automatically. IR sensor detects the
movement of the object, and the power limitations takes place to increase the brightness of the lights. The research on smart street light system is to save a lot of energy and cost of a street light. Here we observed that the main aim of this smart street light system is to reduce the maximum power consumption.
Apparatus
LDR:- A light dependent resistor is a device whose resistivity is a function of incident electromagnetic radiation.
      Light Resistance --> 50 -100k ohm
      Rated Power --> 200 W
      Diameter. --> 3-20 m
IR SENSOR:- An infrared sensor is an electronic instrument used to sense the surroundings by emitting or detecting the infrared radiation. It is capable of detecting the motion of on object.
           Operating voltage --> 3.6~5. Main chip --> LM 393
           Average current consumption --> 0.06 mA
           Distance measuring range -->2-30cm
LED:- Light Emitting Diode.  
       Colour --> white
       Intensity --> 10,000 McD typ at 30 mA.
       DC forward current : 30 mA
       Forward voltage: 2.7V
ARDUINO UNO:- Ardunio UNO is a low cost, flexible, and easy to use programmable open source microcontroller board
that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projec
