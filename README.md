# SMART STREET-LIGHT CONTROLLER
The objective of this product is to design and develop a smart street light controller system is to reduce the power consumption. 
Abstract
Now a days street light system plays a major role in rural areas and also in urban areas.
By using LDR it detects the darkness, then light will glows automatically. IR sensor detects the
movement of the object, and the power limitations takes place to increase the brightness of the lights. The research on smart street light system is to save a lot of energy and cost of a street light. Here we observed that the main aim of this smart street light system is to reduce the maximum power consumption.

Apparatus
LDR:- A light dependent resistor is a device whose resistivity is a function of incident electromagnetic radiation.
      Light Resistance --> 50 -100k ohm
      Rated Power --> 200 W
      Diameter. --> 3-20 m
      
IR SENSOR:- An infrared sensor is an electronic instrument used to sense the surroundings by emitting or detecting the infrared radiation. It is capable of detecting the motion of on object.
           Operating voltage --> 3.6~5. Main chip --> LM 393
           Average current consumption --> 0.06 mA
           Distance measuring range -->2-30cm
           
LED:- Light Emitting Diode.  
       Colour --> white
       Intensity --> 10,000 McD typ at 30 mA.
       DC forward current : 30 mA
       Forward voltage: 2.7V
ARDUINO UNO:- Ardunio UNO is a low cost, flexible, and easy to use programmable open source microcontroller board
that can be integrated into a variety of electronic project.

PROCEDURE:-
• First we need to prepare algorithm for the code. • Make the connections on the breadboard. • Place the LDR on the breadboard and connect one end of the
breadboard to resistor to analog Analog pin and other end to +5V
in Ardunio.

• Take the IR sensor and connect the third pin of the IR sensor to
one is +5V, group pin is a ground and out pin is to analog pin. • Take the LEDs and place them on breadboard and connect
resistors to the negative end of led and to the ground, then the
other end of the led is going to connect with digital pins of
Ardunio.

• Once check the all connections and then write the code on
Ardunio software and dump the code on it and then run it. • We have to prepare the code according to the above
connections.
